- The first step is to open up the terminal and enter this command. Remember to replace zz with the letters in your course-specific account. 

```
$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
- You will see the following message when you are connecting to a new server for the first time. Please answer yes for the message and type in your password. Then, you should be logged in.

```
$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.

RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
- This is the result when you successfully connected to the remote computer / server! You can use it as a reference.
